# Goroutines
Goroutines are a feature of the Go programming language that allow you to run functions concurrently with other functions in a program. A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution that is managed by the Go runtime, which schedules goroutines onto operating system threads as needed.

Goroutines are defined using the go keyword followed by a function call. When a function is called in this way, it is executed concurrently with the rest of the program, allowing for asynchronous execution of code.

Goroutines are designed to be lightweight, which means that creating and starting a new goroutine is relatively cheap in terms of memory and performance. This allows programs written in Go to use many concurrent goroutines without experiencing significant overhead or slowdown.

One of the advantages of using goroutines is that they allow you to write concurrent programs that are easy to reason about and maintain. By breaking up a program into smaller, independent functions that can be run concurrently, you can write code that is more modular and easier to test and debug.

Overall, goroutines are a powerful feature of Go that enable efficient, concurrent programming, and make it easy to write scalable, high-performance software.
